# Optimal Transport — Practice Sessions

This repository contains materials for a practice part of the Optimal Transport course read on January 2026 at IMPA.

---

## Prerequisites

For the practice sessions, the knowledge of:
- Linear algebra
- Basic probability theory
- Python programming (NumPy-level proficiency)
is required.

Also, recommended to be familiar with:
- Convex optimization and duality
- Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks
- Basic knowledge of numerical optimization.

## Course Structure

The material is organized as a sequence of practice sessions:

- Session 1 — [Discrete OT and linear programming formulation](https://github.com/AI-Quantum-Research-Group/OT-Jan-2026/blob/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
- Session 2 — Entropic regularization and Sinkhorn algorithm
- Session 3 — ██████████ █████████ ███████████████ ████ 
- Session 4 — ████████ █████ ███████████████ █████████
- Session 5 — ████████████ ████████████████████ ███████
- Session 6 — ██████████ ███████████████ ███████████████

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with the notebooks in notebooks/, following their numeric order.
2. Read the explanations and run all cells.
3. Complete the corresponding exercises in exercises/.
4. Compare with solutions/ if available.
5. Modify and experiment — numerical behavior is a key learning objective.

The notebooks are designed to be interactive and exploratory, not just demonstrative.
